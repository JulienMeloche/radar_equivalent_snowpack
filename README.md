# Radar equivalent snowpack
- The user inputs provides a multilayered snowpack in a pandas dataframe.
- Refer to the paper DOI: ... 

# Python Libraries required to run the code
- numpy 
- pandas 
- xarray 
- scipy 


# Using radar equivalent snowpack
1. Use grouping and averagin function from res_function.py
2. create an smrt snowpack
3. Run SMRT simulation from
4. Use notebook to reproduce graph from paper
   
# Best method 
The best method is using k-means grouping and the method 'thick-ke-density fro averaging
